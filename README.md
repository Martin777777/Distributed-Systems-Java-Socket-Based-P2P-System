# Introduction

This project represents a Peer to Peer (P2P) system which is used for file sharing.  This document is the operating instruction to the system.

# Open the server of a peer

When a peer is set up in this system, its server is automatically opened and users are able to view the information about the process of opening by reading the information output in the text area of the peer and the main server. If the server of peer is manually closed, the server can be re-opened by clicking the "open" button at the top of the window of the peer.

# Get resource

In this system, peers are able to get resources from other peers. To do that, users just have to click the "Get Resource" button at the top of the peer window. After that, a new window involving a list of buttons that represents all the resources that's in the system but not owned by the peer will be shown. By clicking the button that represents the resource users want, the resource will be transferred to the peer. Users are able to view the information about the process of getting resources by reading the information output in the text area of the peer, the owner peer of the resource and the main server.

# Add File

In this system, peers are able to add files into their own dictionaries. To do that, users just have to click the "Add File" button and choose the file they want in the file choosing window. Note that if the content of the file chosen is the same as the content of a file owned by the peer, the file won't be added successfully and a message will be shown to tell users that the file has been already owned. Users are able to view the information about the process of adding files by reading the information output in the text area of the peer and the main server.

# Remove File

In this system, peers are able to remove files owned by peers. To do that, users just have to click the "Remove File" button and choose the file they want to remove in the file choosing window. Note that if users leave the dictionary and try to remove files that is not in the peer's dictionary, the file won't be removed. Users are able to view the information about the process of removing files by reading the information output in the text area of the peer and the main server.

# Close the server of a peer

To close the server of a peer, user only need to click the "Close" button at the top of a peer window and then the server of the peer will be closed. Users are able to view the information about the process of closing by reading the information output in the text area of the peer and the main server.
